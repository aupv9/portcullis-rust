# 🏰 portcullis

**Per-site captive-portal edge enforcement engine for OpenWrt routers**

*No client reaches the internet until the control plane explicitly authorizes it — and once authorized, the grant is enforced, metered, and expired correctly.*

## 📖 What is this?

`portcullis` is the **data-plane enforcement arm** of an ad-gated public-WiFi captive portal. It runs locally on each site's OpenWrt router (built for the **Teltonika RUTM11** / RutOS) — one router per site, scaling to thousands of independent sites — and does exactly one job well: hold the internet gate shut until the control plane says open, then enforce / meter / expire that grant.

It is the mechanism behind a **video-gate ad slot**: the moment the gate completes, the control plane calls `GrantSession`, and `portcullis` opens the path.

> 🧭 It is **not** a NAS, **not** an ad renderer, **not** a business-logic owner — see [Boundaries](#-boundaries-what-it-deliberately-does-not-do).

Design notes and the load-bearing invariants are summarized below and in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) and the per-area engineering notes in [`.claude/skills/`](./.claude/skills/).

Client **data** breaks out locally at the store's WAN. The engine dials the control plane outbound over an mTLS gRPC stream (the router is behind CGNAT, so it cannot be reached inbound) carrying **control + accounting only** — never client traffic. Identity is the client **MAC** (visible at L2 locally), not IP.

## 🏗️ Architecture

A single Tokio daemon, structured as a Cargo workspace with a **hexagonal** core: every crate depends only on the frozen contract crate `portcullis-types` (data types + port traits); the composition root `portcullis-engined` wires the concrete adapters. This keeps the netfilter-touching code mockable and the domain logic pure.

```
crates/
  🧬 portcullis-types        data types + port traits (the contract hub) — no I/O
  🧱 portcullis-nft          ONLY crate touching netfilter: FirewallBackend, nft -j, writer actor
  🧠 portcullis-session      domain: Session lifecycle, quota, expiry, adoption (pure)
  ↪️ portcullis-redirect     :8080 HMAC-signed 302 responder + neigh MAC lookup
  🌳 portcullis-garden       dnsmasq nftset render + reconcile
  📊 portcullis-accounting   conntrack metering loop + quota trigger + tc shaper
  🔌 portcullis-control      tonic gRPC Enforcement server + mTLS + event fan-out
  ⚙️ portcullis-config       UCI/TOML config: load, validate, hot-reload diff
  🚀 portcullis-engined      composition root: runtime, signals, adoption, shutdown
proto/enforcement.proto      contract shared with the Go control plane
```

### Concurrency model

`SessionManager` is the single point that issues commands to the **nft writer actor** — every netfilter mutation is serialized through one owner, so transactions never race.

## 🔄 Key flows

<summary><b>1. Grant — client gets internet after the ad gate</b></summary>

  loop every 15s
    E->>CP: SessionEvent(INTERIM, bytes)
  end
  Note over E,K: TTL elapses → kernel auto-removes → re-gate ads
```
Fail-closed: `add_auth` runs **before** the session is recorded — a writer error means no session and no internet.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Expiry (dual-path)</b></summary>

- **Kernel path (authoritative):** the `auth` set element's `timeout` elapses → kernel removes it → the client's next `:80` is redirected again (re-gate). Works even if the daemon is dead.
- **Daemon path:** `tick_expiry` emits the accounting `EXPIRED` record and best-effort `del_auth`. Neither path alone can strand a "permanent internet" session.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Revoke</b></summary>

`RevokeSession(mac, reason)` → delete `auth` element → emit `REVOKED` / `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` with final bytes → control plane sends Accounting-Stop.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Restart adoption (deploy a new build, drop nobody)</b></summary>

On start: `ensure_base` (idempotent) → `list_auth` from the kernel → `adopt` rebuilds the in-RAM session view (no `GRANTED` re-emitted) and re-baselines accounting. The kernel is the source of truth, so an upgrade keeps every authorized client online.
</details>

## 🚀 Quick start

> Requires Rust **1.96+** only — `protoc` for the gRPC contract is **vendored** by the build script (no system install needed). Host build = CI-equivalent; the ruleset logic is arch-independent.

```bash
# Build & test the whole workspace
cargo build --workspace
cargo test  --workspace          # 130 tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Run a single crate's tests
cargo test -p portcullis-session expiry

# Run the daemon locally (control level via RUST_LOG; needs nft/ip/conntrack on Linux)
RUST_LOG=debug PORTCULLIS_CONFIG=/etc/config/portcullis cargo run -p portcullis-engined
```

### 📦 Cross-compile for the router (RUTM11)

```bash
# Target: MIPS 1004Kc, little-endian, static musl
cargo build --release --target mipsel-unknown-linux-musl
# Package as an .ipk via the RutOS / OpenWrt SDK (ramips/mt7621).
```

**Full build → install → provision → verify guide: [`deploy/PACKAGING.md`](./deploy/PACKAGING.md)** (or `SDK_DIR=/path/to/sdk ./deploy/build-ipk.sh`).

Runtime dependencies on-device: `kmod-nft-*` + `nftables` userspace and `dnsmasq-full` (declared as package deps).

## 📡 gRPC API — `wifihub.enforcement.v1`

The engine is the **server**; the Go control plane is the client. See [`proto/enforcement.proto`](./proto/enforcement.proto).

| RPC | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GrantSession(GrantRequest) → GrantReply` | CP → engine | Authorize a client (mac, ttl, quota, rate, tier) |
| `RevokeSession(RevokeRequest) → Ack` | CP → engine | Admin/fraud/quota revoke |
| `GetSession(Key) → SessionInfo` | CP → engine | Look up one session |
| `ListSessions(ListRequest) → stream SessionInfo` | CP → engine | Snapshot all sessions |
| `StreamEvents(StreamReq) → stream SessionEvent` | **engine → CP** | GRANTED / INTERIM / EXPIRED / REVOKED / QUOTA_EXCEEDED |
| `Health(Empty) → HealthReply` | CP → engine | backend / kernel-table / cp-connected / reconcile flags |

> 🔒 The engine **never speaks RADIUS** — it emits `SessionEvent`s over the stream; the control plane (NAS-of-record) records them as session accounting in Postgres. **RADIUS has been dropped platform-wide** — there is no FreeRADIUS anywhere.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Sourced from UCI (`/etc/config/portcullis`) or TOML; loaded & validated at startup (`portcullis-config`).

| Option | Example | Hot-reload? |
|---|---|---|
| `store_id` | `SITE-0042` | restart |
| `control_endpoint` | `https://cp.wifihub.internal:8443` (dialed outbound) | restart |
| `cp_server_ca_file` | `/etc/portcullis/tls/cp-ca.crt` | restart |
| `cp_server_name` | `cp.wifihub.internal` | restart |
| `hmac_key_file` | `/etc/portcullis/hmac.key` | restart |
| `responder_port` | `8080` | restart |
| `control_keepalive_secs` | `20` | restart |
| `control_reconnect_max_secs` | `60` | restart |
| `accounting_interval` | `15` (s) | ✅ hot |
| `default_ttl` | `1800` (s) | ✅ hot |
| `default_quota_mb` | `0` (0 = unlimited) | ✅ hot |
| `default_rate_kbps` | `2048` | ✅ hot |
| `garden_fqdn` | `portal.wifihub.vn` (list) | ✅ hot |

mTLS material is provisioned separately at `/etc/portcullis/tls/` — the engine's client identity (`client.crt`, `client.key`) plus the pinned control-plane server CA (`cp-ca.crt`) — never baked into the package.

---

## 🔐 Security model

- **mTLS is the gate.** The engine dials the control plane presenting its per-store **client** cert and verifies the control plane's **server** cert against a pinned CA (`cp_server_ca_file`); with no CA it refuses to dial (no anonymous fallback). The control plane must bind the client cert identity to the `store_id` so one store cannot impersonate another. The router exposes **no inbound port** — its only listener is the LAN-only `:8080` redirect responder.
- **Router-signed identity.** The `:8080` responder signs `HMAC-SHA256(key, "mac|store|ts")`; the portal trusts `mac`/`store` only because the signature validates. The key never reaches the client; verification is constant-time.
- **Hardened attack surface.** The redirect responder reads only the kernel source IP (never client query/body), parses totally and panic-free (cf. openNDS CVE-2023-38314), with per-source rate limiting and a bounded request body.
- **Least privilege.** Runs as a dedicated non-root user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` only; subprocess args are engine-constructed, never client-interpolated.
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` across all crates — **zero `unsafe`**.

## 🧠 Design invariants

> These are load-bearing — violating them causes flash failure, fail-open, or accounting corruption. Enforced by code + tests, and re-checked by [`.claude/agents/portcullis-reviewer`](./.claude/agents) and [`security-auditor`](./.claude/agents).

1. **No fail-open** — every error keeps prior state or fails closed.
2. **No flash writes** — all runtime state in RAM/tmpfs; the kernel + control plane are durability.
3. **Single nft writer** — every mutation funnels through one actor (atomic, ordered).
4. **`accept` is not terminal in nftables** — the `forward` chain *drops* unauth non-garden traffic and lets the rest fall through to fw3.
5. **Kernel-as-truth** — adopt the kernel `auth` set on restart; never flush.
6. **Dual-path expiry** — kernel timeout is the backstop.

## 🪶 Performance & footprint

Tuned for the RUTM11 (MIPS 880 MHz, **256 MB RAM**; budgets: <15 MB binary, <30 MB RSS — TDD §14).

| | Before tuning | After |
|---|---|---|
| Release binary (host arm64) | 6.9 MB | **2.4 MB** (−65%) |
| Runtime regex engine | ~290 KiB | **removed** |

Techniques: size-first release profile (`opt-level="z"`, LTO, `codegen-units=1`, `strip`), dropped `tracing-subscriber` `env-filter`, `SessionId` → `Box<str>`, bounded event buffer, allocation-free HMAC signing. See [`.claude/skills/embedded-perf`](./.claude/skills/embedded-perf).

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace          # 130 unit tests across 9 crates
```

| Crate | Tests | | Crate | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| types | 7 | | garden | 9 |
| config | 16 | | accounting | 9 |
| nft | 21 | | control | 26 |
| session | 11 | | engined | 1 |
| redirect | 30 | | **total** | **130** |

- **Unit:** pure domain (`session`, `redirect` HMAC/parse) + `nft` against a `MockBackend`.
- **Integration (netns):** [`crates/portcullis-engined/tests/netns.rs`](./crates/portcullis-engined/tests/netns.rs) runs the real binary in a router namespace and asserts verdicts (unauth→redirect, garden→allow, authed→forward, expired→re-gate, revoked→drop) + restart adoption. Root-gated + `#[ignore]` (plain `cargo test` skips them); a privileged CI job runs `-- --ignored`. CP-loss + live-flow-reap cases are scaffolded pending a mock control-plane server. See [`.claude/skills/netns-harness`](./.claude/skills/netns-harness).
- **On-device:** RUTM11 acceptance (nft-vs-fw3 priorities, conntrack-under-NAT, flash-write audit).

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] `deploy/` — procd init, OpenWrt SDK `.ipk` Makefile, UCI config, first-boot `uci-defaults` ([`deploy/`](./deploy))
- [ ] MIPS cross-compile validated on-device + size/RSS validation (`-Z build-std`, RutOS SDK)
- [x] `tc`/HTB bandwidth shaping — wired (per-MAC HTB, capability-gated); tc execution pending on-device validation
- [~] Linux netns integration + fault-injection suite in CI — scaffolded (verdict matrix + restart adoption); mock-CP cases (CP-loss, live-flow reap) pending
- [ ] RFC 8910/8908 Captive Portal API (DHCP option 114) alongside CPD redirect
- [ ] Evaluate openNDS-fork (FAS) vs from-scratch — the POC is the go/no-go gate (TDD §17/§18)

---

## 🚫 Boundaries (what it deliberately does *not* do)

- ❌ Speak RADIUS (control plane is NAS-of-record)
- ❌ Ad decisioning / rendering / OTP (portal + ad engine)
- ❌ NAT/masquerade (fw3 already does it) — owns exactly one table, `inet wifihub`
- ❌ Intercept `:443` (CPD probes `:80`; pre-auth `:443` non-garden hits the drop)
- ❌ Fleet orchestration (the engine is a *target* of the control plane's reconcile loop)

---

## 🤝 Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). TL;DR: keep crates dependent only on `portcullis-types`, respect the [design invariants](#-design-invariants), `cargo test --workspace` + `clippy -D warnings` must stay green, and abstract any Linux-only I/O behind a port trait with a mock.
